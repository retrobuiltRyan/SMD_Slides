Quiz Answer Key
Advantages of SMD Technology: SMD components offer smaller size, lighter weight, and higher circuit density compared to through-hole components. This leads to more compact and efficient electronic devices.
Solder Paste: Solder paste is a mixture of tiny solder spheres suspended in flux. It is applied to PCB pads before component placement and, during reflow soldering, melts to form the solder joints. Unlike wire solder, paste allows for simultaneous soldering of multiple components.
Solder Paste Storage: Proper storage is vital because the flux in solder paste can evaporate, leading to dry paste that performs poorly. Paste should be stored in a cool, dry environment, ideally between 0-10°C (32-50°F).
Framed Stencils: Framed stencils are pre-stretched and held taut in a frame, ensuring consistent alignment and reducing the risk of misalignment and defects. This is especially crucial in high-volume production where even slight misalignments can lead to significant losses.
Stenciling Machine Selection: Consider the type of stencil (framed or unframed), the size of PCBs being produced, the required alignment accuracy, and the budget. Framed stencil machines are generally preferred for high-volume production.
Hot Air Tools: Hot air tools offer non-contact heating, making them ideal for delicate components and rework under components. However, they can be slower than soldering irons, especially for boards with large ground planes.
Hot Tweezers: Hot tweezers efficiently heat both sides of SOIC components simultaneously, enabling quick and clean removal or rework without disturbing surrounding components.
Microscope: A microscope provides magnified visual inspection of SMD components and solder joints, allowing for detection of defects like cold solder joints, bridges, and misaligned components.
PPE: PPE such as safety glasses and anti-static wrist straps protect against eye damage from solder splatter and electrostatic discharge (ESD) that can damage sensitive components.
Soldering Defects: Common defects include cold solder joints (dull, concave appearance), solder bridges (solder connecting adjacent pads), and misaligned components (not properly seated on pads).
